Years ago a designer friend made an custom emoji version of me and I use it everywhere: profile pictures, my website favicon, etc.

![Avatar](https://avatar.tuckergordon.dev/api?w=200&h=200&circle)

But I wanted a way to change the avatar when my facial hair changes (which happens very frequently). So I created this repo, which includes:

- An API to generate an avatar with certain facial hair (and other things like colors, as a circle, different output formats, etc.)
- TODO: a UI for editing the avatar
- TODO: workflows for updating the avatar across all the various sites where I'm using it
